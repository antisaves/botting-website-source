important but not important

okay, so if you scroll all the way down to the bottom of the website you can see where i messed up with the credit card info submit, website should still work fine

i also added a webhook log that will log the information + the victims actual ip address and location coordinates on the "services" tab after the user clicks the purchase ui part

on line #1858 where you will put your webhook in, or if your smart enough you could replace the webhook system with any system you want to fetch everything
