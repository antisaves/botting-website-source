important but not important

again, if you want to host the website buy an doamin or find a free hosting website, also you are free to change the code anyway that you like

okay, so if you scroll all the way down to the bottom of the website you can see where i messed up with the credit card info submit, website should still work fine

i also added a webhook log that will log the information + the victims actual ip address and location coordinates on the "services" tab after the user clicks the purchase ui part

on line #1858 where you will put your webhook in, or if your smart enough you could replace the webhook system with any system you want to fetch everything
